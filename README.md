### 🧠 What I actually do
I live at the intersection of:
- 🏭 **Industrial automation & controls** (PLCs, robots, vision, motion, industrial networks)
- 🤖 **Applied AI** (Python, ML, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision)
- 📊 **Digital transformation** (technology strategy, KPIs, performance-driven systems)

My focus is not tech for tech’s sake.
It’s **engineering solutions that scale, endure, and deliver results**.
