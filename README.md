**⚙️🤖🌐 Where smart machines meet smarter minds**
**🚗🔋🦾 Sr. Controls Engineer @ Tesla**
Accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy.

From circuits⚡️ to code 💻


🇲🇽 Mexican engineer living in the United States, with a passion for technology and the kind of challenges that push systems and people to their limits.
I live at the intersection of:
- 🤖 **Applied AI** (Python, ML, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision)
- 🏭 **Industrial automation & controls** (PLCs, robots, vision, motion, industrial networks)

My focus is not tech for tech’s sake.
It’s **engineering solutions that scale, endure, and deliver results**.
